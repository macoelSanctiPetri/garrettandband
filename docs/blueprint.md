## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Amber Yellow (#FFD640) for headers, section dividers, and highlights, to emphasize important elements.
- Background color: Main background is light gray (#F5F5F5) to create a neutral base, and secondary background is white (#FFFFFF) for card containers.
- Text color: Primary text color is dark gray (#1A1A1A) for titles to ensure high readability, while secondary text color is medium gray (#4A4A4A) for body content. Text on amber background is black (#000000)
- Use 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headings and body text to keep a consistent modern look.
- Horizontal, full-width blocks for each section to create a clear visual flow with transitions in solid colors.
- Media icons in red (#FF0000), especially for linking to videos, and black (#000000) as active indicator.
- Subtle animations to keep things interesting when loading sections or when content changes.
